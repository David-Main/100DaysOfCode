# Day13
Say Im at an event and I don't know when I'd close,  
does it mean the function is undefined? ðŸ¤“ðŸ˜…  

Today I covered the intro to functions at least as  
far as revision and updating myself goes.

I revised the basic structure of a function and explored some new concepts..
1. linkage of functions
2. function exceptions the old and the new way
3. using variable arguments in a function

To be honest, I felt a bit reluctant and lazy today but I'm glad I pushed through.
