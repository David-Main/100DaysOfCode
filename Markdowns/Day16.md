# Day16
Templated functions  
instead of creating a library of overloaded functions we  
can use the power of templating to ensure less code, and  
maximum efficiency of the language.  

Also covered was the use of the argument list operator to create  
variadic functions for the purpose of multiple parameters in a  
templated function.
