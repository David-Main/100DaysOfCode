# Day32
Still on data structures in C++.  
Today I really learnt the value of unit testing,  
especially while trying to build a function that manipulates  
dynamic memory A.K.A. "the heap". 
Just a few more steps to go and I'll be done with my linked list class.  

P.S. I had to restart the whole class cause my initial approach was not the best.  
Happy coding guys...
