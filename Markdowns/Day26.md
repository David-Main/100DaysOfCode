## Data structures and Algorithms

The next steps in my journey. Below is a summary of what I covered today, code snippets can be found [here](../CodeFiles/Day26);

## Algorithmic analysis üßê

    Understanding time and space complexity.

## BigO analysis (The worst case scenario)

O stands for the order of complexity.  
Examples of such orders are:

    O[1] 		- Constant time.
    O[log(n)]	- Logarithmic.
    O[n] 		- Linear.
    O[n^2] 		- Quadratic Time.
    O[b^2]		- Exponential Time.
    O[n!] 		- Factorial Time.

In all cases, n is the input size and the resulting  
time indicates the amount of time needed relative to  
the input size, n.

## Linear Data structures

- The Array
- Lists
  - Singly Linked List
  - Doubly Linked List
- Queues
- Stacks
