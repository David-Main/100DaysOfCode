# Day10
Today I continued the broad concept of pointers.  
I learnt and practiced how one can allocate memory. this includes;  
1. using the new keyword to allocate memory as well as the delete keyword for memory deallocation
2. allocating memory using the new keyword with placement fields
3. Handling failed allocations using try catch blocks and the std::bad_alloc class.
4. Handling failed allocations using if else statements and the nothrow constant passed as a placement field.
5. Lifetime of allocated memory
6. How the windows SDK handles memory allocation and deallocation

Today was quite fun, to be honest I feel quite good thus far...  
untill tomorrow, keep being Awesome...
