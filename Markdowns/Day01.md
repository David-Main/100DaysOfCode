# #100DaysOfCode  Day01
Today I continue my journey to becoming an astute software engineer   
with the 100 days of code challenge. Inspired by my good friend Baaba Dampare,   
my aim at the end of this is to be able to plan and execute the creation and   
maintenance of applications and software with a good amount of efficiency,   
efficacy, ability to scale and stand the test of time. 

For this challenge I will be using C++ as by language of choice since I have   
had some introduction to it during these past few months of my freshmen year's   
second semester.
As much as I start out by revising the basics, I will also be touching some   
rather advanced concepts as I go along.   
Good luck to me :-)   
As a little something extra, I designed this flyer just for the fun of it.   

Starting out today, here are the things I did/learnt.

	1. Get acquainted with the IDE

	2. The basic layout of a C++ program
		a. The  main function
		b. The return statement
      	c. Parameters available to the main function
      	d. Using the command line to pass parameters to a 
		   program for possible bash scripting
		
	3. The different preprocessor directives
		a. #include statements
		b. #define statements
		c. Macros
		d. Symbols used for conditional compilation
		e. Pragmas to prevent duplication of header files
	
	4. Basics of program Dependencies
		a. Libraries : code that is already defined usually in header files.
			i. Static libraries - precompiled libraries
			ii. Dynamic libraries - code isn't compiled; 
				linker adds the information needed during runtime
			iii. Precompiled headers to reduce compile time
			
		b. Program structure
			i. Targets: the output of a build step
			ii. Dependencies the inputs of a build step
			
		c. Makefiles: rules(custom or compiler specific)
		   that the make tool follows to build out project files with basic syntax of;   
			Targets : dependents
				Commands
