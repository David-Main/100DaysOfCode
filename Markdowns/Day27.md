# Day27
Had some challenges today, couldn't do much,
I revisited the simple terminal calculator app I was building, then  
I cleaned up my stuff a bit and uploaded my current progress as far  
as the code snippets are concerned to GitHub, while doing this I learnt  
more GitHub commands and how to push my code from a local source to my  
online repo instead of just dragging and dropping.

I also made a nice portfolio GitHub readme file.
