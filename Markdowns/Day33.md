# Day33
Today was exciting; Here's what I did:  
- Wrote an algorithm to reverse a linked list.  
- Learnt about recursion.  
- Wrote an algorithm to print out the Fibonacci sequence using:  
  - recursion  
  - iterative programming    
and then compared the results; time complexities.  

- Wrote an algorithm to print out the factorial of a number using recursion  
- Wrote an algorithm to print out contents of a linked list using recursion.  

until tomorrow, happy coding...
