# Day24

Today I uploaded most of my code and experiences to  
GitHub as a way of getting more acquainted with the site.

I also solved one challenge on code wars, which by  
the way gave me another EUREKA moment,

Yet, you could imagine how small I felt after comparing [my code](../CodeFiles/Day24/codeWars.cpp)  
to someone elses which was like 80% smaller than mine ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚.
