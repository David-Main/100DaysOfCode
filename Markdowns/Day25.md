# Day25

After solving a bunch of challenges on code wars,  
I graduated to a higher rank (7 kyu).  
I can really feel my skills have improved since Day01.

Then I took a closer look at some sequential containers  
and some of their various operations.

Why; it makes your code so much easier and frankly I  
now don't see how you can get around in C++ without them.
