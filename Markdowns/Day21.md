# Day21

Today was all about vectors and strings in C++  
Its basically a build up of some of the fundamentals  
of classes, yet they are unique in their own way.

I learnt a lot from initialization to manipulations like  
changing of letter cases, growing a vector and etc.  
It feels like [a long list of code snippets](../CodeFiles/Day21/Day21practice.cpp) too while practicing along.
