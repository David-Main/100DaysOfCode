# Day09
Today I tried to wrap my head around the concept of  
pointers and arrays in c++ concepts covered include;   
- Types of memory  
 	* the stack  
 	* the heap    
- Null pointers and their uses   
- Pointer arithmetic   
- Arrays as function parameters  
- Multidimensional arrays  
- Passing multidimensional arrays to functions  

These were interesting to learn and it even gives you a whole  
new perspective on memory management and how a computer works.  
That's it for today, till tomorrow...
