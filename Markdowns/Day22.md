# Day22

Today I had a lot of practice with the IO libraries  
and types that C++ has to offer; the file stream,  
string stream and the iostream for consoles... really  
interesting huh.

I can really feel a lot of improvement compared to  
when I began some weeks ago, yet I know I've still got  
a few million miles to go ðŸ™‚ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…
