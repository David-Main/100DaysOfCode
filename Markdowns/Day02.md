# #100daysofcodechallenge --Day 02
Today I practiced what I learnt yesterday by creating a simple 
guessing game which uses multiple files both source and headers 
and are compiled and linked together using the makefile I created.
wasn't the easy but I made it ;-)
 
## Approach -How the game should go:

-Computer randomly picks a number

-User guesses the number

-The computer checks if true

-If true congratulate user

-If false give a failed user
 
## Functions In sight

Random number generation function

Validation function

Victory image display
