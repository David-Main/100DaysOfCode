# Day29
Today I managed to get the python script working with saved webpages and  
at least organized some playlists I downloaded.

## The problem now:  
is to make it work with real URL as YouTube apparently has some  
anti web-scraping technologies at work.
Code can be found [here](https://github.com/David-Main/Youtube-Playlist-File-Organizer)

## In other news...ðŸ˜€
I also continued my studies of Data structures and will upload my notes  
to GitHub for referencing. Feel free to check it out.

Until tomorrow,
