# #100daysofcodechallenge --Day 01:
Today I continue my journey to becoming an astute software engineer with the 100 days of code challenge.
Inspired by my good friend Baaba Dampare, my aim at the end of this is to be able to plan and execute the creation and maintenance of applications and software with a good amount of efficiency, efficacy, ability to scale and stand the test of time.
 
For this challenge I will be using C++ as by language of choice since I have had some introduction to it during these past few months of my freshmen year's second semester.
As much as I start out by revising the basics, I will also be touching some rather advanced concepts as I go along.
Good luck to me :-)
As a little something extra, I designed this flyer just for the fun of it.
 
Starting out today, here are the things I did/learnt.
1. Get acquainted with the IDE
2. The basic layout of a C++ program
a. The main function
b. The return statement
3. Parameters available to the main function
b. Using the command line to pass parameters to a program for potential bash scripting
 
4. The different preprocessor directives
a. #include statements
b. #define statements
c. Macros
d. Symbols used for conditional compilation
e. "#Pragma once" to prevent duplication of header files
 
5. Basics of program Dependencies
a. Libraries : code that is already defined usually in header files.
b. Program structure
c. Makefiles: rules(custom or compiler specific) that the make tool follows to build out project files.
