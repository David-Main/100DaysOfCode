You are good 
You are kind
You are more than these
I'm lost for words trying to descrobe you
Elohin, Elyon Ale...

Your greatness is all I've seen
There is nothing, you cannot do
There's no mountain you cannot move
if you have said it, then you will do it.

Im free from the guilt of tomorrow
Im free praise the Lord free at last.
