# Day06
Today I continued to build out the simple calculator app from yesterday;   
workflow and code management has greatly improved yet the debugging part   
still needs work.


## Hopeful?
At least i got it to work for the first possible scenario yet it failed   
on me after the second compile process...   
I think I'll have to do what all programmers arguably do,   
GOOGLE IT 😂😏😏  
That is it for today I give it another go tomorrow
