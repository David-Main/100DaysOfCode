# Code begat code😎😅

It is truly amazing how we can leverage the simplest  
of tools to ease and automate tasks...  

## My problem 😕😕
So I had a number of audio Bible files that I wanted  
to sort because after I had decompressed them they  
weren't soretd as they were when I compressed them,  

I knew how to move one file to a new location  
yet I didn't know enough batch scripting to sort  
the entire collection at a go.  
But I knew python and how to generate a batch file  
complete with all the list of commands that I  
needed (They weren't too many either)

## So, the solution... 🧐🧐
A python code that generates a batch script which I used to sort the  
files into various corresponding folders.

## Caveat
Unless you have the solution code tailored to your exact set of  
files, it won't work.  
i.e. The code is not generic.  

Also, the code is not really refactored or beautified. 🥴😏😏

## Lesson learned
- What would have taken me 5 minutes to do now took less than 30 seconds.  
- With code we can truly make life a lot easier.
