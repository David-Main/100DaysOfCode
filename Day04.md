# #100daysofcodechallenge --Day 04
Today I did some reading and practice on various language features as I delve deeper into the language and then continued to explore some c++ types and their various forms. here's the scope of todays session...

### 1. Using operators

  - a. Operator precedence  
  - b. Arithmetic operators  
  - c. Bitwise operators  
  - d. Boolean operators  
  - e. Assignment operators  
  - f. Bitwise shift operators 
### 2. Conditionals

  - a. Looping with iterations  
  - b. Looping through an iterative object without iterators  
  - c. While and do while loops  

### 3. Exploring c++ built in types 

  - Integers 
  - Types of integers  
  - Specifying integer literals- specifying longs or shorts and hex or octal values  
  - Floats and doubles  
  - Characters and character macros  
  - Intro to strings: string literals  
  - Raw strings R"( â€¦ )"  
  - Void keyword  
### 4. Initializers

  - By assignment
  - By function calling syntax 
  - By constructor syntax
  - List initializer
  - Automatic variables
### 5. Storage classes

  - Static and extern at file scope for various linkages
  - thread_local to prevent deadlocks
  - Volatile to allow changes by external actions
  - Typedefs for type aliasing
  - The using statement for type aliasing: seems much more readable than the typedefs
