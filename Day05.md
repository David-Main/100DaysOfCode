# Day05

Today I started creating a simple command line calculator

## Approach: 
1. Take in the arguments from the command line.    
a. Arguments should be in the form arg1 op arg2
2. Convert the given parameters from string to numerical values and operator
3. Calculate the result of given operation
4. Print out to console the result.

## Possible errors:
1. If arguments given is not enough print out the usage of the function 
2. If arguments are not valid print out the usage of the function    
a. Arg1 and arg2 are not numbers   
b. Op is not + - / or *
3. If number of arguments(3) are not valid, print out the usage function

## Functions used:
1. The usage function: to describe how the calculator should be used on the terminal
2. A string conversion function: to convert the arguments passed into integers and operators
3. The main function to put it all together.

## Bugs
Unfortunately, it was a bit challenging: but I guess i already knew it wasn't going to be easy....  
As much as I wanted to complete the app today, I couldn't;  
There were a number of setbacks such as;    
• The use of the namespace on the string identifier before it will  
link properly to the main translation unit.   
• Managing the files just got so confusing that I keep going from   
one file to the other before remembering where exactly to go and what to do. 

## Lesson learned
Overall I think I was a little too overambitious  
that I seem to be forgetting to be procedural or  
meticulous in my practicality of creating the app.  
For now I am going to take a pause and have at it again tomorrow.
